# d3react
ready to use chart components built with react & d3-3.5.17 

## Introduction

d3react is a **Redefined** chart library built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [D3](http://d3js.org).

The main purpose of this library is to help you to write charts in React applications without any pain. Main principles of d3react are:

1. **Simply** deploy with React components
1. **Native** SVG support, lightweight depending only on some D3 submodules
1. **Declarative** components, components of charts are purely presentational
